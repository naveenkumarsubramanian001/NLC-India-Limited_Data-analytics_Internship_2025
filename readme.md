## ðŸ“˜ Day 1 â€“ SQL Command Exploration & Reporting

On Day 1 of my internship, I was tasked with exploring and experimenting with **a wide range of SQL commands and operators** using **MariaDB** and **MySQL** in a **WAMP Server** environment installed on my local computer.

The task involved:

- Testing all types of SQL commands:  
  - **DDL** (e.g., `CREATE`, `DROP`)  
  - **DML** (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`)  
  - **DCL** (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`)  
  - **TCL** (e.g., `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`)  
  - **DQL** (e.g., `SELECT`, with filtering and grouping)

- Experimenting with various **SQL operators**:  
  Arithmetic, Logical, Comparison, and Special operators.

- Creating a **detailed report** documenting:
  - The syntax and purpose of each command  
  - The dataset/tables used  
  - Execution output  
  - Observations and key learnings

### âœ… Tools & Environment:
- **WAMP Server**  
- **MariaDB & MySQL**  
- **Command Line Interface + phpMyAdmin**

### ðŸ“„ Deliverables:
- A structured report showcasing each command and result  
- SQL script files used during the experiments
