## ðŸ“Š Day 2 â€“ Sales Dashboard Development in Power BI

On Day 2 of my internship, I explored and mastered key functionalities in **Power BI** by developing a fully functional **Sales Performance Dashboard**. This dashboard was created to analyze retail performance across various dimensions including product categories, regions, retailers, and time (day of week, quarter, year).

### ðŸ”§ Tools and Skills Used:
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Data Modeling & Relationships**
- **Slicers and Filters**
- **Card Visuals, Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Line Graphs**
- **Custom Formatting, Tooltips, and Interactivity**

### ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Highlights:

- **KPI Cards**: Displaying Total Sales ($900M), Operating Profit ($332M), Profit Percentage (36.91%), and Units Sold (2M)
- **Sales by Method**: Bar chart showing breakdown by In-store, Outlet, and Online sales
- **Total Sales by Region**: Donut chart showing sales contribution from West, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Midwest
- **Top Performer Insights**:
  - **Top Product**: Men's Street Footwear
  - **Top Retailer**: West Gear
- **Sales Trends**: Line chart visualizing total sales by day of week
- **Product-wise Analysis**: Bar chart comparing sales and profit across various product lines

### ðŸ§  What I Learned:
- End-to-end Power BI workflow from data loading to dashboard deployment
- Effective use of slicers for dynamic filtering (Year, Quarter, Region, Retailer)
- Best practices in dashboard layout, visual hierarchy, and user interactivity
- Interpreting sales KPIs and extracting actionable insights
