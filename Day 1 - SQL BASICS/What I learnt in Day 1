Day 1 Internship Report – NLC India Limited
SQL Commands Experimentation using MariaDB & MySQL (WAMP Server)
📅 Date: [Insert Date Here]
🏢 Internship: NLC India Limited
Department: [Insert Department if known]
Role: Intern – Database and Backend Systems

📌 Overview
On Day 1 of my internship at NLC India Limited, I was given a hands-on task to explore and experiment with all types of SQL commands including DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, and DQL. I executed each command in both MariaDB and MySQL using the WAMP Server setup on my local machine.

The objective was to understand the functionality of each command, observe its behavior, and document the results. I created a detailed report showcasing the syntax, command used, description, and output.

💻 Tools Used
Database Server: MariaDB & MySQL

Environment: WAMP Server (Windows)

SQL Interface: MySQL Command Line & phpMyAdmin

Editor: Notepad++ / VS Code (Optional)

🧠 What I Learned
✅ SQL Command Categories Explored:
DDL (Data Definition Language)

CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, RENAME

DML (Data Manipulation Language)

INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REPLACE

DCL (Data Control Language)

GRANT, REVOKE

TCL (Transaction Control Language)

COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

DQL (Data Query Language)

SELECT, including complex queries with WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.

✅ Operators Practiced:
Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %

Comparison: =, !=, <>, <, >, <=, >=

Logical: AND, OR, NOT

Special: BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, IS NULL, EXISTS

📄 Output Report
I created a structured report where each command is accompanied by:

SQL Syntax

Description of its purpose

The table/data it was used on

Screenshot or written output of the result

Notes or observations (e.g., behavior difference between MariaDB & MySQL if any)

🔍 Key Takeaways
Understood core SQL operations and database behavior.

Learned to differentiate between command types and their real-world usage.

Gained experience in using MariaDB and MySQL interchangeably.

Strengthened my foundational skills for advanced database tasks in the upcoming days of the internship.
